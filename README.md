# WordToExcel-Public-Documentation
This repository serves as the documentation for **WordToExcel**, a Python automation tool developed to process a massive **48,000-page Word document**.   The system extracts structured data — including student violations, case handlers, dates, and case statuses — and exports them into **CSV format** for easy analysis.
